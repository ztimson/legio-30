			<p>
				Harvest marked the traditional end of the Roman campaign season and the start of <em>mare clausum</em> (closed sea) in the <em>mare nostrum</em> (Mediterranean Sea) while the sea was most dangerous. Imperial troops that slept in <em>sub pellibus</em> (tents)
				inside the <em>castra aestiva</em> (summer camps) began preparations to relocate to more hospitable <em>castra hiberna</em> (winter camps), where they were housed in stone lodgings impervious to the elements.
			</p>
			<p>In the fall, the indigenous people had to focus their efforts on harvesting crops & preparing for the cold harsh winter. This left little time for raids & hostilities giving Roman soldiers time to rest, train & recoup.</p>
			<h2 class="mb-2">Details</h2>
			<p>
				Tom Ross hosts a Castra Hiberna event every September near Tillsonburg Ontario. It's a private single day event between Romans and their adversaries. It's an excellent opportunity for new Roman reenactors. If May doesn't work for you, consider coming to
				<a routerLink="/events/castra-aestiva">Castra Aestiva</a> in May.
