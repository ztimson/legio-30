			<p>
				Janus is the double-faced god of archways, entrenches, passages, time, the beginning & the end. The Romans
				named January in his honor & was one of the 12 principal deities of <em>Religio Romana</em> (Roman Religion).
				Janus was unique to Latium (centeral western Italy), predating the Romans & had no Greek counterpart.
			</p>
			<p>
				Janus had his ceremonies carried out by the <em>Rex Sacrorum</em> (King of the Sacred) instead of
				dedicated <em>flamens</em> (priests) like the other deities. The shrine <strong>Janus Geminus</strong> was
				dedicated to him which had giant double doors which would be closed in times of peace and left open during times
				of war. The Roman historian <strong>Titus Livius</strong> would recount the doors being closed only twice
				between the time of <strong>Numa Pompilius</strong> (7th century BC) and <strong>Augustus</strong> (1st century BC).

				coming to <a routerLink="/events/aestiva">Castra Aestiva</a> in May or <a routerLink="/events/hiberna">Castra Hiberna</a> in September.
